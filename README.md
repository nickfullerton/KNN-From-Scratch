# KNN-From-Scratch

KNN Machine Learning Algorithm from scratch using NumPy, and visualizing with MatPlotLib  
This was done through a student led workshop at The Machine Learning Club at ASU



## Description 


### Built With  

* [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)
* [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
* [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
* [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)
* [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
* [SciPy](https://scipy.org/)
* [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/)


### Overview

This was a project I did on Jupyter Notebook during a student led workshop at The Machine Learning Club at ASU.  
The project consisted of taking a .csv file of iphone purchase records, and see if we can take the age and salary of an individual and accurately predict if they purchased a Iphone  

The algorithm was K Nearest Neighbor, we decided to implement the algoritm from scratch just to get a better understanding of the algorithm and to fully grasp the concept.
